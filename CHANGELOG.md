## Migration Guide

### Upgrading from 1.x to 2.x

#### Breaking Changes
- Risk scoring scale changed from 0-10 to 0-20
- UI structure completely redesigned
- Some function names updated for consistency

#### Migration Steps
1. Update HTML structure to use new dashboard layout
2. Adjust risk threshold values (multiply by 2)
3. Update CSS selectors if customized
4. Test new export functionality

#### Code Changes
```javascript
// Old (v1.x)
if (riskScore > 5) { /* high risk */ }

// New (v2.x)
if (riskScore > 10) { /* high risk */ }
```

### API Compatibility
- All core functions remain backward compatible
- New functions added without breaking existing implementations
- Export functions are new additions
